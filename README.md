MedScreen AI - Advanced Cancer Biomarker Detector 🧬🩺
Overview
MedScreen AI is an advanced cancer risk assessment tool that leverages machine learning to analyze blood biomarkers for early cancer detection. It uses Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting models to predict risks for various cancers, such as lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.

Features 🚀
✅ Early Cancer Detection – Identifies risk levels using blood biomarkers
✅ Machine Learning Models – Supports Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting
✅ User-Friendly UI – Built with Tkinter, featuring interactive analysis
✅ Data Visualization – Uses Seaborn & Matplotlib for biomarker trends
✅ Custom Risk Threshold – Adjustable sensitivity for medical use
✅ Medical Disclaimer – Designed for research & support, not direct diagnosis

Supported Biomarkers:
The model analyzes various blood test markers, including:

CRP, CA125, PSA, CEA, CA19.9, AFP (cancer-associated proteins)

Hemoglobin, WBC, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Platelets (blood composition)

Albumin, ALP, GGT (liver function markers)
